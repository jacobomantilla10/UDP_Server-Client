It was a particularly interesting Summer League for the Rockets with all three first-round picks - Jabari Smith Jr., Tari Eason and TyTy Washington - showing promise for the future.</p><p><em>Here's what we saw in Saturday's Summer League finale against the Kings as well as what we can take away from the games as a whole ...</em></p>    <div id="paywall" class="content-wrapper">            <h2>Rockets vs. Kings</h2><p>The Rockets lost their Summer League finale to the Sacramento Kings, 92-81. Fifth overall pick Keegan Murray, possibly the most impressive offensive player in this year's Summer League, was held out by the Kings. The Rockets were led by Tari Eason's 19 points (7-for-14 shooting). TyTy Washington scored 15 points on 6-for-14 from the floor and Jabari Smith Jr., scored 12 points on 4-for-15 shooting from the floor.</p><p>Smith looked like a future Defensive Player of the Year in this game. I didn't think it would be possible, but he's actually been even better defensively than I could have ever expected. On multiple occasions, he blew up pick and rolls, nimbly switching out onto the perimeter to swallow up guards. On one play late in the second half, he rotated from the weak side to meet an opponent at the rim, gobbling up the shot attempt with one hand while maintaining possession. Smith appears to be able to do it all defensively and will be a true anchor for this Rockets lineup in due time.</p>            <p>However, in what has been a disturbing trend, Smith's shooting in this game left much to be desired. It's been a struggle from downtown for Smith during Summer League - he was 1-for-4 from 3 against the Kings - a surprising development given his accuracy from distance in college. Smith's mechanics have looked off, with his shot looking very flat, so it's possible that the issue stems from fatigue. In no way am I alarmed (it's Summer League!) but it's something to keep an eye on because the shooting was the biggest strength of Smith's overall game. To his credit, Smith did hit a stepback 3-pointer off the dribble in the second half that offered a glimpse of some later possibilities.</p>            <p>And now, with this having been the finale, after being tantalized by raw potential for nearly two weeks, we endure the hardship of the long wait over the summer months until preseason.</p>            <h2>Summer League takeaways</h2><figure class=" extendFromGrid fXS fSM fMD fLG fXL"><picture class="image deferred threeTwo" data-width="2048" data-height="1590"  data-progressive="true" data-component="picture"><source data-srcset="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/1200x0.jpg 1x, https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/2400x0.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 1292px)"><source data-srcset="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/1150x0.jpg 1x, https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/2300x0.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 1230px)"><source data-srcset="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/1100x0.jpg 1x, https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/2200x0.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 1168px)"><source data-srcset="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/1050x0.jpg 1x, https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/2100x0.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 1106px)"><source data-srcset="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/1000x0.jpg 1x, https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/2000x0.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 1044px)"><source data-srcset="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/950x0.jpg 1x, https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/1900x0.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 982px)"><source data-srcset="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/900x0.jpg 1x, https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/1800x0.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 920px)"><source data-srcset="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/850x0.jpg 1x, https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/1700x0.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 858px)"><source data-srcset="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/800x0.jpg 1x, https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/1600x0.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 796px)"><source data-srcset="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/750x0.jpg 1x, https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/1500x0.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 734px)"><source data-srcset="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/700x0.jpg 1x, https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/1400x0.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 672px)"><source data-srcset="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/650x0.jpg 1x, https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/1300x0.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 610px)"><source data-srcset="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/600x0.jpg 1x, https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/1200x0.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 548px)"><source data-srcset="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/550x0.jpg 1x, https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/1100x0.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 486px)"><source data-srcset="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/500x0.jpg 1x, https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/1000x0.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 424px)"><source data-srcset="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/450x0.jpg 1x, https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/900x0.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 362px)"><source data-srcset="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/400x0.jpg 1x, https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/800x0.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 300px)"><img class="landscape" data-src="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/26/44/03/22692034/3/1200x0.jpg" alt="Tari Eason #17 of the Houston Rockets drives against Eugene Omoruyi #25 of the Oklahoma City Thunder during the 2022 NBA Summer League at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center on July 09, 2022 in Las Vegas, Nevada."></picture><figcaption><span class="caption"><p>Tari Eason #17 of the Houston Rockets drives against Eugene Omoruyi #25 of the Oklahoma City Thunder during the 2022 NBA Summer League at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center on July 09, 2022 in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p></span><span class="credits">Ethan Miller/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've written before about how before last season, I never paid much attention to Summer League and certainly didn't watch the games. During the James Harden Era, the Rockets were contenders and thus, never had any top prospects. There was no reason to tune in. To that end, these last two years have been a completely new experience. In watching Summer League, you're basically trying to glean something from your first glimpse at a 19-year-old, playing against semi-pro talent, surrounded by talent far inferior to what he'll enjoy in the majors. The final score from the game is probably the least important result. Last year I wrote that I had no idea who Jalen Green would eventually become, noting that he moved off-ball much more willingly than I had expected. I feel similarly this year about Smith - I have no idea what his ceiling could be. He looks even more malleable than projected.</p>    <aside class="article--content-inline"><aside class="zone"><div class="mostPopular">        <div class="collectionHeader" role="heading" aria-level="2">Most Popular</div>                                                <ol class="mostPopular--list">                                                                    <li class="mostPopular--list-item" role="heading" aria-level="3">                            <a class="mostPopular--list-title hdn-analytics" href="/politics/article/Mothers-Against-Greg-Abbott-ad-viral-PAC-17314385.php" title="Mothers Against Greg Abbott releases 'ready to fight' ad denouncing Texas Gov.
